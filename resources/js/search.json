[[{"i":"hello","l":"Hello! \uD83D\uDC4B","p":["I enhance patient health and biological understanding by unlocking the potential of multi-omic data sets through my work as a cross-domain scientist and data coordination leader for large research consortia. As an expert in ensuring data quality and AI-readiness with a focus on spatial biology methods, I am committed to nurturing impactful collaborative communities of data sharing and reuse."]}],[{"l":"Cancer Grand Challenges Rosetta"},{"l":"About","p":["Rosetta was a Cancer Research UK-funded project led by Professor Josephine Bunch at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL, UK). The initiative began in 2017 as part of the 3D Tumour Mapping Challenge, bringing together over 70 experts from physics, biology, chemistry, biochemistry, and technology innovation to revolutionize the way cancer metabolism was visualized.","The challenge was to develop mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) techniques capable of creating Google Earth-like maps of tumours at an unprecedented level of detail. By integrating multiple MSI modalities, the team aimed to measure and spatially map metabolites, proteins, lipids, amino acids, and carbohydrates across tumour samples, providing a holistic view of cancer metabolism in both experimental models and patient tissues.","Over its seven-year span, Rosetta pioneered multimodal-multiscale MSI pipelines and computational tools that linked in vitro findings with ex vivo and in vivo measurements. These innovations led to critical discoveries, such as:","Identifying arachidonic acid as a metabolic vulnerability in PIK3CA-driven breast cancers, with potential dietary intervention strategies.","Demonstrating how pantothenic acid (Vitamin B5) was linked to MYC-driven tumour metabolism.","Highlighting new therapeutic targets, including SLC7A5 in KRAS-driven colorectal cancer and AHCY in APC-deficient tumours.","Collaborating with AstraZeneca to integrate MSI into drug development, providing insights into compound distribution and resistance mechanisms."]},{"l":"My Role","p":["Within Rosetta, I contributed to data analysis, computational integration, and spatial biology applications. My focus was on:","Collecting MALDI and DESI MSI datasets to map tumour metabolism in MYC-driven breast cancer models","Integrating MSI with histology and immunofluorescence (IF) images to enhance spatial correlations between molecular and morphological features","Visiting scientist at the Francis Crick Institute, expanding expertise in MSI and collaborative research on tumour metabolism.","Through this work, I helped refine spatial metabolomics workflows, ensuring they were reproducible, scalable, and interpretable for downstream applications in cancer research and potential clinical translation."]}],[{"i":"human-tumor-atlas-network-htan","l":"Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN)"},{"l":"About","p":["Launched in 2018, the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) is an NCI-funded Cancer Moonshot initiative focused on building 3D atlases of human cancers. Through a network of Research Centers and a central Data Coordinating Center (DCC), HTAN maps out the molecular and cellular changes that occur as cancers develop and progress. The goal is to understand key transitions, such as:","How pre-malignant cells become cancerous","How tumors grow, spread, and respond to treatment","What drives resistance to therapies.","HTAN includes a broad range of cancer types, including those that disproportionately affect minority and underserved populations, hereditary cancers, and aggressive pediatric cancers.","The network manages data from 2,147 participants, 201,000 files from 30 bulk, single-cell, and spatial assays, and over 250 million cells—creating one of the most comprehensive resources for cancer research.","Phase 1 (2018–2024) brought together ten Research Centers and two pilot projects—the Pre-Cancer Atlas Pilot Project (PCAPP) and the Human Tumor Atlas Pilot Project (HTAPP). The DCC played a central role in coordinating efforts, developing data standards, and making the data available to the broader research community.","Now in Phase 2 (2024–2029), HTAN has expanded to support ten additional centers, building on the foundation of Phase 1 with improved analytical methods, a broader data model, and stronger integration across projects."]},{"l":"My Role","p":["I’m a Principal Investigator for the HTAN Data Coordinating Center, working across four DCC institutions and 20 HTAN atlas programs to support data ingestion, governance, and collaboration. As PI, I lead Sage Bionetworks' contribution to the DCC, including data model development, data ingestion and validation, and data governance. I am also the technical lead for imaging and spatial datasets.","Over the past few years, I’ve worked in different roles within HTAN, including as a scientist, imaging expert, data liaison, and data model manager. Through this, I’ve built strong connections with HTAN’s research centers, our DCC partners, and NCI."]},{"l":"Resources","p":["HTAN Data Portal","HTAN Manual"]}],[{"l":"PhD Research"},{"l":"About","p":["Bone health depends on a delicate balance between building and breaking down the extracellular matrix (ECM). In inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, this balance is disrupted, leading to bone loss. My PhD research explored how inflammation affects the ECM by using lab-grown bone-like structures called cell-secreted matrices (CSMs). These matrices were created by growing bone cells (osteoblasts) in the lab, allowing them to build their own ECM before removing the cells to leave behind a scaffold for study.","I investigated how inflammatory molecules (cytokines like IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ) change ECM composition and how this, in turn, affects new bone cell behavior. To analyze these effects, I used a highly sensitive surface analysis technique called Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), alongside imaging and biochemical techniques. My findings provided new insights into how inflammation weakens bone ECM, which could help design better biomaterials and regenerative treatments for inflammatory bone diseases."]},{"l":"My Role","p":["I designed and carried out the experiments, developed the protocols for producing and analyzing CSMs, and optimized the use of ToF-SIMS for ECM analysis. I also conducted cell culture experiments to see how osteoblasts responded to cytokine-exposed ECM. My work involved interdisciplinary collaboration with biomaterials scientists, cell biologists, and imaging experts, and included a research visit to the University of Washington’s NESAC/BIO group to refine my mass spectrometry analysis."]}],[{"l":"Appointments","p":["Director of Cancer Biology Sage Bionetworks, Seattle, USA (Remote from the UK)","Principal Scientist[Sage Bionetworks]( https://sagebionetworks.org, Seattle, USA (Remote from the UK)","Senior Research Scientist[Sage Bionetworks]( https://sagebionetworks.org, Seattle, USA (Remote from the UK)","Senior Research Scientist National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, UK","Higher Research Scientist National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, UK","Research Associate NESAC/BIO, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"]}],[{"l":"Education","p":["University of Nottingham, School of Pharmacy Thesis: Analytical and cellular investigations of cell-secreted matrices from cytokine-challenged environments.
