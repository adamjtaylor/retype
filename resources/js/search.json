The initiative began in 2017 as part of the 3D Tumour Mapping Challenge, bringing together over 70 experts from physics, biology, chemistry, biochemistry, and technology innovation to revolutionize the way cancer metabolism was visualized.","The challenge was to develop mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) techniques capable of creating Google Earth-like maps of tumours at an unprecedented level of detail. By integrating multiple MSI modalities, the team aimed to measure and spatially map metabolites, proteins, lipids, amino acids, and carbohydrates across tumour samples, providing a holistic view of cancer metabolism in both experimental models and patient tissues.","Over its seven-year span, Rosetta pioneered multimodal-multiscale MSI pipelines and computational tools that linked in vitro findings with ex vivo and in vivo measurements. These innovations led to critical discoveries, such as:","Identifying arachidonic acid as a metabolic vulnerability in PIK3CA-driven breast cancers, with potential dietary intervention strategies.","Demonstrating how pantothenic acid (Vitamin B5) was linked to MYC-driven tumour metabolism.","Highlighting new therapeutic targets, including SLC7A5 in KRAS-driven colorectal cancer and AHCY in APC-deficient tumours.","Collaborating with AstraZeneca to integrate MSI into drug development, providing insights into compound distribution and resistance mechanisms."]},{"l":"My Role","p":["Within Rosetta, I contributed to data analysis, computational integration, and spatial biology applications. My focus was on:","Collecting MALDI and DESI MSI datasets to map tumour metabolism in MYC-driven breast cancer models","Integrating MSI with histology and immunofluorescence (IF) images to enhance spatial correlations between molecular and morphological features","Visiting scientist at the Francis Crick Institute, expanding expertise in MSI and collaborative research on tumour metabolism.","Through this work, I helped refine spatial metabolomics workflows, ensuring they were reproducible, scalable, and interpretable for downstream applications in cancer research and potential clinical translation."]}],[{"l":"Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN)"},{"l":"About","p":["Launched in 2018, the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) is an NCI-funded Cancer Moonshot initiative focused on building 3D atlases of human cancers. Through a network of Research Centers and a central Data Coordinating Center (DCC), HTAN maps out the molecular and cellular changes that occur as cancers develop and progress. The goal is to understand key transitions, such as:","How pre-malignant cells become cancerous","How tumors grow, spread, and respond to treatment","What drives resistance to therapies.","HTAN includes a broad range of cancer types, including those that disproportionately affect minority and underserved populations, hereditary cancers, and aggressive pediatric cancers.","The network manages data from 2,147 participants, 201,000 files from 30 bulk, single-cell, and spatial assays, and over 250 million cells—creating one of the most comprehensive resources for cancer research.","Phase 1 (2018–2024) brought together ten Research Centers and two pilot projects—the Pre-Cancer Atlas Pilot Project (PCAPP) and the Human Tumor Atlas Pilot Project (HTAPP). The DCC played a central role in coordinating efforts, developing data standards, and making the data available to the broader research community.","Now in Phase 2 (2024–2029), HTAN has expanded to support ten additional centers, building on the foundation of Phase 1 with improved analytical methods, a broader data model, and stronger integration across projects."]},{"l":"My Role","p":["I’m a Principal Investigator for the HTAN Data Coordinating Center, working across four DCC institutions and 20 HTAN atlas programs to support data ingestion, governance, and collaboration.

Technologies including CyCIF, CODEX, MIBI, IMC, and Immuno-SABER are now central to large-scale atlas programs like the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) and HuBMAP. However, this high dimensionality creates a fundamental visualization challenge: how do you generate an informative image preview that captures the full heterogeneity of a 40+ channel image?","Traditional approaches using multi-channel overlays are limited to 4-6 channels before colors become indistinguishable, discarding the vast majority of captured information. Data portals presenting thousands of imaging datasets need thumbnails that enable researchers to quickly recognize tissue features, assess heterogeneity, and recall previously viewed samples.","Miniature solves this by treating each pixel as a point in high-dimensional space and using unsupervised dimensionality reduction to project the full channel information into 2D or 3D coordinates that can be mapped to perceptually meaningful colors. The result: a single thumbnail image where similar colors indicate similar protein expression profiles, revealing tissue architecture and pathological features without requiring any prior knowledge of marker identity."]},{"l":"Scientific Approach","p":["The Miniature pipeline operates on OME-TIFF pyramidal images through four stages:","1. Pyramid Selection & Background Removal Low-resolution pyramid layers are extracted to enable fast processing. Otsu thresholding automatically segments tissue from background, focusing computation on biologically relevant pixels.","2. Dimensionality Reduction Three methods are supported:","UMAP: Preserves local neighborhood structure, revealing tissue heterogeneity","t-SNE: Strong local structure with different global characteristics","PCA: Fast linear projection for rapid previews","3. Perceptually Optimized Color Encoding For 3D embeddings, I implemented the U-CIE algorithm in Python, which optimizes the fit of the embedding point cloud into the sRGB portion of L*a*b* color space through rotation, translation, and scaling. This maximizes perceptual distinguishability while ensuring all colors are displayable. For 2D embeddings, six bivariate colormaps (BREMM, SCHUMANN, STEIGER, TEULING2, ZIEGLER, CUBEDIAGONAL) provide alternatives optimized for different perceptual tasks.","4. Quality Assessment Trustworthiness metrics based on Venna & Kaski (2001) quantify how well the thumbnail preserves neighborhood relationships from the original high-dimensional data. I extended this with perceptual trustworthiness using CIEDE2000 color difference, measuring whether perceptually similar colors truly reflect similar protein expression profiles."]},{"l":"Validation & Results","p":["Systematic parameter evaluation across 92 combinations of dimensionality reduction method, scaling, and colormap revealed that UMAP to 3D with UCIE color encoding provides the optimal balance of perceptual trustworthiness and visual appeal. Critically, perceptually distinct regions in Miniature thumbnails correspond to:","Known pathological features visible in H&E staining of the same section","Leiden clusters generated from cell segmentation and unsupervised clustering","Tissue structures including tumor regions, immune infiltrates, and stromal compartments","Color vision deficiency simulations confirmed that thumbnails remain interpretable across deuteranopia, protanopia, tritanopia, and other CVD variants—ensuring accessibility for the estimated 8% of males affected by color vision deficiency."]},{"l":"My Role","p":["I am the sole author and developer of Miniature.

In inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, this balance is disrupted, leading to bone loss. My PhD research explored how inflammation affects the ECM by using lab-grown bone-like structures called cell-secreted matrices (CSMs). These matrices were created by growing bone cells (osteoblasts) in the lab, allowing them to build their own ECM before removing the cells to leave behind a scaffold for study.","I investigated how inflammatory molecules (cytokines like IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ) change ECM composition and how this, in turn, affects new bone cell behavior. To analyze these effects, I used a highly sensitive surface analysis technique called Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), alongside imaging and biochemical techniques. My findings provided new insights into how inflammation weakens bone ECM, which could help design better biomaterials and regenerative treatments for inflammatory bone diseases."]},{"l":"My Role","p":["I designed and carried out the experiments, developed the protocols for producing and analyzing CSMs, and optimized the use of ToF-SIMS for ECM analysis.
