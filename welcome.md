I enhance patient health and biological understanding by unlocking the potential of multi-omic data sets through my work as a cross-domain scientist and data coordination leader for large research consortia. As an expert in ensuring data quality and AI-readiness with a focus on spatial biology methods, I am committed to nurturing impactful collaborative communities of data sharing and reuse.
